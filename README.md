<h2 align="center">Intro & Purpose</h2>
<h3 align="center">Intro</h3>
Daily, incremental presentation of relevant and challenging information is efficient, fun and provides a foundation for learning, communication and confidence which extends beyond the walls of classroom and corporate office alike.

<br>

<h3 align="center">Purpose</h3>

- <strong>What is it?</strong>

The AI Daily Dose is a Slack channel where a random AI word/concept is sent daily. It includes a definition and a link to learn more. Users can then interact by posting and sharing anecdotes, images, or memes relating to the AI concept.

But interaction is not limited to the topic of the day. Members are encouraged to share any AI/ML related information in the channel.

<br>

- <strong>Why should you join?</strong>

It's a great way to grow, spread, and practice your AI knowledge. Some people in the channel are strictly learners, while others with more experience can impart their knowledge. Furthermore, it allows people who are interested in AI to network and socialize.

<br>
 	   
- <strong>What will you get out of it?</strong>

Often, people are so busy with daily tasks that they don't have time to keep up with their AI learning and networking. By joining this channel, IT professionals can establish a consistent pattern of daily AI learning and interaction. This can take as little as one minute (e.g., reading a word and its definition), while those who want to dive deeper or contribute to the discussion have the opportunity to do so.
