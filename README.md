<h2 align="center">Intro & Purpose</h2>
<h3 align="center">Intro</h3>


Before my career in information technology, I was an educator. I began teaching inner-city kids in a summer camp, where I learned, practiced and taught many valuable lessons, including the importance of having fun and in keeping a positive daily routine. Later, I taught for the government and was inspired by the use of technology to save lives (both government and civilian). 

This was a catalyst for leading me back to computer technology (I was a programmer and technophile as a child). Finally, after earning a Master's in Education and while teaching aborad, I learned how to utilize Information and Communications Technology (ICT), in a daily routine, in order to transfer knowledge to students, essentially using some of the very technologies which serve to distract them, to teach them and to provide them the tools to teach themsleves.

Daily, incremental presentation of relevant and challenging information is efficient, fun and provides a foundation for learning, communication and confidence which extends beyond the walls of classroom and corporate office alike.

<strong>What is it?</strong>

The AI Daily Dose is a Webex space where a random AI word/concept is sent daily. It includes a definition and a link to learn more. Users can then interact by posting and sharing anecdotes, images, or memes relating to the AI concept.

But interaction is not limited to the topic of the day. Members are encouraged to share any AI/ML related information in the space.

<br>

<strong>Why should you join?</strong>

It's a great way to grow, spread, and practice your AI knowledge. Some people in the space are strictly learners, while others with more experience can impart their knowledge. Furthermore, it allows people who are interested in AI to network and socialize.

<br>
  	  
<strong>What will you get out of it?</strong>

Often, people are so busy with daily tasks that they don't have time to keep up with their AI learning and networking. By joining this space, IT professionals can establish a consistent pattern of daily AI learning and interaction. This can take as little as one minute (e.g., reading a word and its definition), while those who want to dive deeper or contribute to the discussion have the opportunity to do so.
